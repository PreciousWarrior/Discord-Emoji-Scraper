# Discord-Emoji-Scraper
Scrapes emojis of a discord server/guild and downloads them to your machine, in case you lost the original emojis for your own server or would like to download emojis for any other server to use elsewhere. Supports animated and standard emojis.

To use the program simply download the repo, extract the zip file, make sure you have python 3.9 installed, then run the .py script-: python3 emojiscraper.py. Then follow the instructions.

If you have any questions create an issue in the github repo.
If you are facing any errors, bugs or having suggestions, create an issue in the GitHub repo.
If you would like to work on any of the TODO points in the code, feel free to work on them and add a PR
